-- reservation manager.
-- given a list of all mods and a IO implementation,
-- this object reads in a list of paths from their reservation configurations.
-- the IO impl's open method is passed a modname and a (top-level only) filename.
-- it must return a file object that at least supports the lua io file:lines() iterator operation,
-- or nil if the file name does not exist.

-- when reserving a hierachial path (such as java-style com.foo.bar...),
-- the fully-qualified path gets reserved by the owning mod,
-- but the paths "above" it (e.g. com, com.foo) become shared.
-- other mods can still reserve non-exact matches under shared paths,
-- but cannot reserve an existing reserved path or it's descendants
-- (e.g. other mods can still reserve com.foo.anotherbar,
-- but not com.foo.bar again or com.foo.bar.sub).
-- however, if a path has been made shared already (e.g. the above com.foo)
-- due to a reservation of a sub-path under it,
-- then attempting to reserve it will also fail.
-- in the internal tables, reservations are marked by a string modname,
-- shared paths (with possible sub-entries) are marked by a table,
-- and not-yet-seen paths are nil in their would-be parent.
-- each level down through the tables represents one more level of sub-component.
--[[
toplevel = {
	com = {
		foo = {
			bar = "modname",
			anotherbar = "othermodname"
		},
	},
}
]]
-- takes the top-level table as described above and an array of path components.
-- pathtostring depends on the path type and is used to turn the path back into a string for error messages;
-- it is passed a component array and a length.
